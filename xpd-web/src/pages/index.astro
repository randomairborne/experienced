  <h2>Why Experienced?</h2>

  <h3>There Are No Paywalls</h3>

  <p>
    Experienced is run by a single person and is written to make use of its
    resources as efficiently as possible. This allows it to easily be funded out
    of pocket- but donations are greatly appreciated. You can donate via <a
      href="https://github.com/sponsors/randomairborne">GitHub sponsors</a
    >, of which 100% will go to funding bot hosting and development. Many
    features locked behind paywalls in other bots, such as automated role
    assignment and card customization, are absolutely free in experienced.
  </p>

  <h3>It's Super Fun</h3>

  <p>
    Experienced is a ton of fun to customize. You control every aspect of your
    rank card, from the font to the layout and color of the progress bar. Create
    custom cards with ease, or copy them from your friends with the card fetch
    command. Add toys to your rank cards, and use your <i>incredible</i>
    graphic design skills to make the most humane rank cards ever designed.
  </p>

  <h3>It's Super Powerful</h3>

  <p>
    Experienced has a ton of features for server owners. Everything from free,
    automatic assignment of roles based on levels, with multiple options for
    customization within that, to a default card in your server to show server
    spirit, to XP importing and exporting to facilitate easy bulk management and
    data portability. Audit logging ensures your users know the system is fair,
    so you can give out rewards in total confidence.
  </p>

  <h3>It's Open Source</h3>

  <p>
    Experienced is fully open-source, so you can verify that it doesn't collect
    your data or the data of the users in your server. Even if you don't trust
    that, you can check the "Data Access" section of the bot's Discord profile
    and note the lack of "Read Messages". You can even host your own instance
    for added security and peace of mind. <a href="https://valk.sh/discord"
